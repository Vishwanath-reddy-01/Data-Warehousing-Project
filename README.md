# Data Warehousing with SQL Server

I’m building this data warehousing project as a focused upskilling exercise to strengthen my fundamentals in data modeling and ETL design.
Goal is simple and practical: sharpen real-world skills by designing, implementing, and iterating on solutions that mirror production scenarios.
This is hands-on learning with intent, driven by curiosity, discipline, and the need to stay technically relevant rather than comfortable.
